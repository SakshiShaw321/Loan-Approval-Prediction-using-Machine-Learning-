# üè¶ Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning

### üìò Overview

This project predicts **loan approval status** based on customer financial and demographic data using multiple machine learning models.
It analyzes factors such as income, CIBIL score, education, and asset values to determine loan eligibility.

### üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Verified data integrity (no missing values)
* Checked class distribution for `loan_status`
* Compared **CIBIL scores** for approved vs rejected loans
* Visualized relationships between income, loan amount, and approval

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Stripped whitespace in column names
   * Encoded categorical variables
   * Split data into train (80%) and test (20%) sets

2. **Model Training & Evaluation**

   * Trained multiple classification models
   * Computed Accuracy, Precision, Recall
   * Visualized feature importance

---

### üìä Key Insights

* Higher **CIBIL score** and **annual income** significantly increase loan approval likelihood.
* **Random Forest** and **Decision Tree** models deliver the highest accuracy.
* Logistic Regression provides interpretable results with solid baseline performance.
* Loan rejections are concentrated in low CIBIL score ranges (300‚Äì700).
